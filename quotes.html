          Kilburn</span></h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“It seems silly but if I could have joined the RAF as a
          pilot, I would have done that, but I was relegated to navigator or
          some such, and that was not quite so appealing. It sounds egotistical
          but I like to lead. I like to be in charge and I didn’t fancy the idea
          of being driven and crashed by some other character. I wanted to do my
          own driving and crashing.” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“We just got on with our work, day by day, and enjoyed
          what we were doing. The University gave us the freedom to get on with
          it.” </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">"Yorkshiremen never worry about class. If I met
          somebody snooty, I would just think he was an idiot." </p>
