      <h2>Perspective</h2>
      <p>As we near the end of Moore's Law, I'm excited to see the industry move
        away from raw performance and focus more on efficiency. Seeing as we are
        such a computerized society, we need to start working on making our
        computer circuits more energy efficient along with the processes we use
        to make those circuits. With the ever growing threat that climate change
        presents, our reliance on computerized technologies will force us to
        reduce the carbon footprint from our electronics. The inefficiencies in
        our systems consumes more electricity and as we improve them we can
        begin to lessen their impact on our electric grid and ultimately reduce
        our carbon emissions. </p>
