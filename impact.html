      <h2>Ramifications</h2>
      <p>Moore's Law has led to the ever increasing computerization and
        digitization of our lives and the economy. We walk around with phones
        with more computational power than the Apollo 11 space capsule. Moore's
        Law has been the guiding principle for the semiconductor industry, with
        the industry using it to plan their product releases and research
        efforts.&nbsp; The computer systems that have been created with this
        technology provide us access to nearly limitless amounts of information
        and easy global communication. As the cost of technology plummets,
        industries all over the globe have moved their production and workloads
        into digital spaces. This has made manufacturing more efficient, but has
        had a negative impact on workers in the labor economy that have been
        replaced by the increasingly automatized workforce. This has led to a
        growing opportunity gap, with those who can't afford higher education
        finding themselves unable to find high income jobs. </p>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>As we reach the inflection point on transistor production density, the
        industry's plans for the future are changing. Rather than trying to make
        marginal gains in production efficiencies, technology companies have
        moved toward cloud computing. By moving the computational strain to the
        cloud, individual devices will be able to make more effective use of the
        resources available to those systems. In addition to cloud computing,
        companies will move toward making specialized chips that help to speed
        up particular programs. Those techniques will allow for the creation of
        better AI and deep learning algorithms, which will be used to further
        create more efficient designs and continue the gains in efficiency that
        Moore's Law has offered, but without the reliable timetable that the
        industry has enjoyed since the idea's publication in 1965. </p>
