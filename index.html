      <p class="list">Gordon Moore is one of the co-founders of the Intel
        Corporation in 1968. In 1965, Moore would become famous for his
        predictions on the increasing efficiency of printed circuits.</p>
      <p class="list">In April 1965,Gordon Moore published a paper in
        Electronics magazine entitled "Cramming more components onto integrated
        circuits". Moore had noticed that microchip capacity was doubling every
        year and predicted the trend would continue for another ten years. In
        1975 Moore revised his prediction to doubling every 18 to 24 months.
        That rate of increase would later became known as Moore's Law, named
        after him.</p>
